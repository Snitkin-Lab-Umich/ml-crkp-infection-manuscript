Code and some data relevant to this manuscript. Manuscript [here](https://msystems.asm.org/content/6/2/e00177-21).

Please note that, since some of the data we used is PHI, we are not able to provide full reproducibility; however, all scripts used to perform the analyses are included in the `scripts` directory and we provide the genomic data used as input to the machine learning models.
