Code and some data relevant to this manuscript. Preprint [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147306v3).

Please note that, since some of the data we used is PHI, we are not able to provide full reproducibility; however, all scripts used to perform the analyses are included in the `scripts` directory and we provide the genomic data used as input to the machine learning models.
