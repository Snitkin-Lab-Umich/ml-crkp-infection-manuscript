# Machine learning models to identify patient and microbial genetic factors associated with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection

Code and some data relevant to this manuscript. Preprint coming soon!

Please note that, since some of the data we used is PHI, we are not able to provide full reproducibility; however, all scripts used to perform the analyses are included in the `scripts` directory and we provide the genomic data used as input to the machine learning models.
